# Amrita Nair's Portfolio Website

## Description
This portfolio website will give viewers a glimpse into my technical expertise in web development. I plan on enhancing this website to include more information regarding my work experience, projects I build as part of the bootcamp and also link an updated resume. 

I drew inspiration from the portfolio's listed [here](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/web-developer-portfolio) to come up with the design for my page. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cKF5CeqMW6kyK9OeRHGZpYNoohz6Mrrw9kvizvTqFwE/edit?usp=sharing) is the wireframe that I had designed prior to coding it up. Once other website that I referred was wix.com on how to configure the fonts for my webpage.

I have used google fonts [(rye)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rye) for my header and footer elements. 

I did struggle with having the background image in the 'about' section of my page and spent a considerable amount of time on it before deciding to skip it as it did not sit well with my webpage flow. I also struggled with the 'Project' section to align the images as given in the mockup. How to work with images will definitly be an area that I will be revisiting to get a proper understanding. I did take help from the internet and ChatGPT to figure that section out. The webpage is responsive with breakpoints at 996px, 768px and 465px. 

In the 'Projects' section I have linked three of the projects that I worked on as part of the bootcamp so far. The rest are placeholders which I will update eventually.
